# What's New

## Neo UI

This version introduces a next-generation WebUI preview.
You may toggle the switch in the session list view to use the "neo" session list and launcher,
which provides slick and streamlined UI.


## Storage management

<!-- (TODO)
### Fine-grained access control

Now projects may have their own administrators who can add or remove users belonging to the project and project-owned vfolders without manual intervention by the super-administrator.
Under the hood, the storage management subsystem has adopted a fine-grained RBAC to declare and query the privilege for a user to perform a specific action on a target object,
allowing more fine-grained customization of storage access policies for large enterprises.

### The trash bin of vfolders

When users delete a vfolder, it is now sent to the trash bin instead of immediately removing all its contents. 
This allows users or admins to undo accidental deletions, and decouples the storage backend's directory removal process from the vfolder management system.
Backend.AI now avoids indefinite hanging of user/vfolder removal requests due to unexpected I/O delays or storage failures.


## FastTrack

(TODO)


## Cotnainer image management

Users can now trigger and cancel the session creation process and the required image pulling process separately,
helping the users to manage sessions stuck in the "PULLING" status due to various reasons (NFS mount failures, a broken Docker daemon, etc.).


## Resource management

Backend.AI Manager now incorporates the concept of reconcilation loops to synchronize session and container states with external systems such as local Docker daemons in the agent nodes.


## High-availability setup

When deployed with `haproxy` and a sentinel-based Redis cluster, it provides a better master-failover handling to improve long-term stability in HA setup scenarios.
