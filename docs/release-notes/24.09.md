# What's New

## Model Serving

(TODO)
<!-- auto-scaling -->


## Model Store

This release upgrades the model store with the metadata browser and improved UI.
Users can now import and run a model directly from configured external model repository services like HuggingFace.


## NVIDIA NIM Integration

If users have a valid license for NVIDIA NIM, they can launch a NIM container with one click as a model service.


## Fine-grained Access Control

(TODO)
<!--
Now projects may have their own administrators who can add or remove users belonging to the project and project-owned vfolders without manual intervention by the super-administrator.
Under the hood, the storage management subsystem has adopted a fine-grained RBAC to declare and query the privilege for a user to perform a specific action on a target object,
allowing more fine-grained customization of storage access policies for large enterprises.
-->


## FastTrack

(TODO)
<!-- project-wide collaboration -->


## Neo WebUI

This version continues transition to the next-generation WebUI.
(TODO: more details)


<!--
## Cancellable Image Pulling

Users can now trigger and cancel the session creation process and the required image pulling process separately,
helping the users to manage sessions stuck in the "PULLING" status due to various reasons (NFS mount failures, a broken Docker daemon, etc.).
