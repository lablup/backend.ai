# What's New

## Neo WebUI

This version introduces a next-generation WebUI preview with the dark-mode support.
You may toggle the switch in the session list view to use the "neo" session list and launcher,
which provides more streamlined UI.


## TUI Installer

From this release, we ship an open-source version TUI installer as a self-contained single-binary executable.
This installer is packaged using [the science project](https://github.com/a-scie) and provides a terminal-based GUI (aka TUI) for easier setup.


## Model Store

It introduces a globally shared predefined "model-store" project where users may clone the model vfolders to their accounts.


## VFolder Trash Bin

When users delete a vfolder, it is now sent to the trash bin instead of immediately removing all its contents. 
This allows users or admins to undo accidental deletions, and decouples the storage backend's directory removal process from the vfolder management system.


## User-defined Image Commit

When allowed by the administrator, users may commit a running session's main container as a new container image.
