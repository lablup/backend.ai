Install on Premise
==================


#. Prepare the instances and databases.

   * 1x SSL certificate with a private key for your own domain (for production)
   * 1x gateway server
   * 1x agent server
   * 1x PostgreSQL server
   * 1x Redis server
   * 1x etcd cluster

     * It is up to you whether to setup a HA-enabled multi-server cluster or a single-server cluster with backups.
     * Check out [[this page|Install etcd]] for details. If you install etcd on the same instance where the manager runs, you could try using docker-compose configuration in this meta-repository's code.

   * 1x network-accessible storage server (NAS) with NFS/SMB mounts

     * All should be in the same private network (LAN).

   * Depending on the cluster size, different service daemons may run on the same physical server.
