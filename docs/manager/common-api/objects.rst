.. _batch-execution-query-object:

Batch Execution Query Object
----------------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 5 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description
   * - ``build``
     - ``str``

     - The bash command to build the main program from the given uploaded files.

       If this field is not present, an empty string or ``null``, it skips the build step.

       If this field is a constant string ``"*"``, it will use a default build script provided
       by the kernel.
       For example, the C kernel's default Makefile adds all C source files
       under the working directory and copmiles them into ``./main``
       executable, with commonly used C/link flags: ``"-pthread -lm -lrt -ldl"``.

   * - ``exec``
     - ``str``

     - The bash command to execute the main program.

       If this is not present, an empty string, or ``null``, the server only
       performs the build step and ``options.buildLog`` is assumed to be
       ``true`` (the given value is ignored).

   * - ``clean``
     - ``str``

     - The bash command to clean the intermediate files produced during the build phase.
       The clean step comes *before* the build step if specified so that the build step
       can (re)start fresh.

       If the field is not present, an empty string, or ``null``, it skips the clean step.

       Unlike the build and exec command, the default for ``"*"`` is do-nothing
       to prevent deletion of other files unrelated to the build by bugs or
       mistakes.

.. note::

   A client can distinguish whether the current output is from the build phase
   or the execution phase by whether it has received ``build-finished`` status
   or not.

.. note::

   All shell commands are by default executed under ``/home/work``.
   The common environment is:

   .. code-block:: text

      TERM=xterm
      LANG=C.UTF-8
      SHELL=/bin/bash
      USER=work
      HOME=/home/work

   but individual kernels may have additional environment settings.

.. warning::

   The shell does NOT have access to sudo or the root privilege.
   Though, some kernels may allow installation of language-specific packages in
   the user directory.

   Also, your build script and the main program is executed inside
   Backend.AI Jail, meaning that some system calls are blocked by our policy.
   Since ``ptrace`` syscall is blocked, you cannot use native debuggers
   such as gdb.

   This limitation, however, is subject to change in the future.

Example:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "build": "gcc -Wall main.c -o main -lrt -lz",
     "exec": "./main"
   }


.. _execution-result-object:

Execution Result Object
-----------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 5 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``runId``
     - ``str``
     - The user-provided run identifier.
       If the user has NOT provided it, this will be set by the API server upon the first execute API call.
       In that case, the client should use it for the subsequent execute API calls during the same run.

   * - ``status``
     - ``enum[str]``

     - One of ``"continued"``, ``"waiting-input"``, ``"finished"``, ``"clean-finished"``, ``"build-finished"``,
       or ``"exec-timeout"``.
       See more details at :ref:`code-execution-model`.

   * - ``exitCode``
     - ``int | null``
     - The exit code of the last process.
       This field has a valid value only when the ``status`` is ``"finished"``, ``"clean-finished"`` or ``"build-finished"``.
       Otherwise it is set to ``null``.

       For batch-mode kernels and query-mode kernels *without* global context support,
       ``exitCode`` is the return code of the last executed child process in the kernel.
       In the execution step of a batch mode run, this is always 127 (a UNIX shell common practice for "command not found")
       when the build step has failed.

       For query-mode kernels with global context support, this value is always zero,
       regardless of whether the user code has caused an exception or not.

       A negative value (which cannot happen with normal process termination) indicates a Backend.AI-side error.

   * - ``console``
     - ``list[object]``

     - A list of :ref:`console-item-object`.

   * - ``options``
     - ``object``

     - An object containing extra display options.  If there is no options indicated by the kernel, this field is ``null``.
       When ``result.status`` is ``"waiting-input"``, it has a boolean field ``is_password`` so that you could use
       different types of text boxes for user inputs.

   * - ``files``
     - ``list[object]``

     - A list of :ref:`execution-result-file-object` that represents files
       generated in ``/home/work/.output`` directory of the
       container during the code execution .

.. _console-item-object:

       For example, if the virtual folder name is ``abc``, you can access it on
       ``/home/work/abc``.

       If the name contains a colon in the middle, the second part of the string indicates
       the alias location in the kernel's file system which is relative to ``/home/work``.

       You may mount up to 5 folders for each session.

   * - ``clusterSize``

.. _resource-slot-object:

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``cpu``
     - ``str | int``
     - The number of CPU cores.

   * - ``mem``
     - ``str | int``
     - The amount of main memory in bytes.
       When the slot object is used as an input to an API,
       it may be represented as binary numbers using the binary scale suffixes
       such as *k*, *m*, *g*, *t*, *p*, *e*, *z*, and *y*, e.g., "512m", "512M",
       "512MiB", "64g", "64G", "64GiB", etc.
       When the slot object is used as an output of an API, this field is
       **always** represented in the unscaled number of bytes as strings.

       .. warning::

          When parsing this field as JSON, you must check whether your JSON
          library or the programming language supports large integers.
          For instance, most modern Javascript engines support up to
          :math:`2^{53}-1` (8 PiB -- 1) which is often defined as the
          ``Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`` constant.
          Otherwise you need to use a third-party big number calculation
          library.  To prevent unexpected side-effects, Backend.AI always
          returns this field as a string.

   * - ``cuda.device``
     - ``str | int``
     - The number of CUDA devices.
       Only available when the server is configured to use the CUDA agent plugin.

   * - ``cuda.shares``
     - ``str``
     - The virtual share of CUDA devices represented as fractional decimals.
       Only available when the server is configured to use the CUDA agent plugin
       with the fractional allocation mode (enterprise edition only).

   * - ``tpu.device``
     - ``str | int``
     - The number of TPU devices.
       Only available when the server is configured to use the TPU agent plugin
       (cloud edition only).

   * - (others)
     - ``str``
     - More resource slot types may be available depending on the server configuration
       and agent plugins.
       There are two types for an arbitrary slot: "count" (the default) and "bytes".

       For "count" slots, you may put arbitrary positive real number there,
       but fractions may be truncated depending on the plugin implementation.

       For "bytes" slots, its interpretation and representation follows that of
       the ``mem`` field.

     - ``int`` (Byte)
     - The pre-configured shared memory size.
       Client can send humanized strings like '2g', '128m', '534773760', etc,
