Client Session
==============

.. module:: ai.backend.client.session
.. currentmodule:: ai.backend.client.session

This module is the first place to begin with your Python programs
that use Backend.AI API functions.

The high-level API functions cannot be used alone -- you must initiate a client
session first because each session provides *proxy attributes* that represent API
functions and run on the session itself.

To achieve this, during initialization session objects internally construct new types
by combining the :class:`~ai.backend.client.base.BaseFunction` class with the
attributes in each API function classes, and makes the new types bound to itself.
Creating new types every time when creating a new session instance may look weird,
but it is the most convenient way to provide *class-methods* in the API function
classes to work with specific *session instances*.

When designing your application, please note that session objects are intended to
live long following the process' lifecycle, instead of to be created and disposed
whenever making API requests.
