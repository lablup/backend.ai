"Inside containers, each kernel is a simple daemon process that accepts "
"user code snippets and replies with its execution results via TCP-based "
"ZeroMQ connections. The rationale to use ZeroMQ is: 1) it is message-"
"based; we do not have to concern the message boundaries and encodings, 2)"
" it automatically reconnects when the connection is lost due to network "
"failures or packet losses, 3) it is one of the most universally supported"
" networking library in various programming languages."

"컨테이너 내부에서 각 커널은 TCP 기반 ZeroMQ 연결을 통해 사용자 코드 스니펫을 받아들이고 "
"실행 결과를 회신하는 간단한 데몬 프로세스입니다. ZeroMQ를 사용하는 근거는 1) 메시지 기반으로 "
"메시지 경계와 인코딩을 신경 쓸 필요가 없고, 2) 네트워크 장애나 패킷 손실로 연결이 끊기면 "
"자동으로 다시 연결되고, 3) 다양한 프로그래밍 언어에서 가장 보편적으로 지원되는 네트워킹 "
"라이브러리 중 하나이기 때문입니다."

#: ../../dev/repl.rst:127
msgid ""
"If you want to allow users to have real-time interactions with your "
"kernel using web-based terminals, you should implement the PTY mode as "
"well. A good example is `our \"git\" kernel runner "
"<https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-kernel-"
"runner/blob/master/src/ai/backend/kernel/git/__init__.py>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev/repl.rst:130
msgid ""
"The key concept is separation of the \"outer\" daemon and the \"inner\" "
"target program (e.g., a shell). The outer daemon should wrap the inner "
"program inside a pseudo-tty. As the outer daemon is completely hidden in "
"terminal interaction by the end-users, the programming language may "
"differ from the inner program. The challenge is that you need to "
"implement piping of ZeroMQ sockets from/to pseudo-tty file descriptors. "
"It is up to you how you implement the outer daemon, but if you choose "
"Python for it, we recommend to use asyncio or similar event loop "
"libraries such as tornado and Twisted to mulitplex sockets and file "
"descriptors for both input/output directions. When piping the messages, "
"the outer daemon should not apply any specific transformation; it should "
"send and receive all raw data/control byte sequences transparently "
"because the front-end (e.g., terminal.js) is responsible for interpreting"
" them. Currently we use PUB/SUB ZeroMQ socket types but this may change "
"later."

"Optionally, you may run the query-mode loop side-by-side. For example, "
"our git kernel supports terminal resizing and pinging commands as the "
"query-mode inputs. There is no fixed specification for such commands yet,"

"A best practice (not mandatory but recommended) for PTY mode kernels is "
"to automatically respawn the inner program if it terminates (e.g., the "
"user has exited the shell) so that the users are not locked in a \"blank "
"screen\" terminal."
