"AWS and other cloud providers offer auto-scaling groups so that they "
"control the number of VM instances sharing the same base image within "
"certain limits depending on the VMs' CPU utilization or other resource "
"metrics. You could use this model for Backend.AI, but we recommend some "
"customization due to the following reasons:"
msgstr ""
"AWS 및 기타 클라우드 제공 업체는 Autoscaling 그룹을 제공하여 VM의 CPU 사용률 또는 기타 리소스 "
"지표에 따라 특정 제한 내에서 동일한 기본 이미지를 공유하는 VM 인스턴스 수를 제어합니다."
"이 모델을 Backend.AI에 사용할 수 있지만, 다음과 같은 이유로 커스터마이징을 권장합니다."


#: ../../install/configure-autoscaling.rst:16
msgid ""
"Backend.AI's kernels are allocated a fixed and isolated amount of "
"resources even when they do not use that much. So simple resource "
"metering may expose \"how busy\" the spawned kernels are but not \"how "
"many\" kernels are spwned. In the perspective of Backend.AI's scheduler, "
"the latter is much more important."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install/configure-autoscaling.rst:17
msgid ""
"Backend.AI tries to maintain low latency when spawning new compute "
"sessions. This means that it requires to keep a small number of VM "
"instances to be at a \"hot\" ready state -- maybe just running idle ones "
"or stopped ones for fast booting. If the cloud provider supports such "
"fine-grained control, it is best to use their options. We are currently "
"under development of Backend.AI's own fine-grained scaling."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Backend.AI scheduler treats GPUs as the first-class citizen like CPU "
"cores and main memory for its capacity planning. Traditional auto-scaling"
