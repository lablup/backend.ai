" codes. Each vfolder (virtual folder) is created under a designated "
"storage mount (called \"vfolder hosts\"). Virtual folders are mounted "
"into compute session containers at ``/home/work/{name}`` so that user "
"programs have access to the virtual folder contents like a local "

"requirement is that the local mount-point must be same across all cluster"
" nodes (e.g., ``/mnt/vfroot/mynfs``). Common setups may use a centralized"
" network storage (served via NFS or SMB), but for more scalability, one "
"might want to use distributed file systems such as CephFS and GlusterFS, "
