"The development setup uses a mono-repository for the backend stack and a "

"production setup uses per-service independent virtual environments and "

"There are three ways to run both the backend and frontend stacks for "
"development, as demonstrated in :numref:`dev-setup-standard`, :numref"
":`dev-setup-app`, and :numref:`dev-setup-staticwebui`. The installation "
"guide in this page using ``scripts/install-dev.sh`` covers all three "
"cases because the only difference is that how you launch the Web UI from "
"the mono-repo."
