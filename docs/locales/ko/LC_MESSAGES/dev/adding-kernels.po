"The key concept is separation of the \"outer\" daemon and the \"inner\" "
"target program (e.g., a shell). The outer daemon should wrap the inner "
"program inside a pseudo-tty. As the outer daemon is completely hidden in "
"terminal interaction by the end-users, the programming language may differ "
"from the inner program. The challenge is that you need to implement piping "
"of ZeroMQ sockets from/to pseudo-tty file descriptors. It is up to you how "
"you implement the outer daemon, but if you choose Python for it, we "
"recommend to use asyncio or similar event loop libraries such as tornado and "
"Twisted to mulitplex sockets and file descriptors for both input/output "
"directions. When piping the messages, the outer daemon should not apply any "
"specific transformation; it should send and receive all raw data/control "
"byte sequences transparently because the front-end (e.g., terminal.js) is "
"responsible for interpreting them. Currently we use PUB/SUB ZeroMQ socket "
"types but this may change later."
