"The image list is automatically filtered by: 1) the allowed docker "
"registries of the current user's domain, 2) whether at least one agent in "
"the union of all agents from the allowed scaling groups for the current "
"user's group has the image or not. The second condition applies only when "
"the value of ``group`` is given explicitly. If ``scaling_group`` is not "
"``null``, then only the agents in the given scaling group are checked for "
"image availability instead of taking the union of all agents from the "
"allowed scaling groups."
