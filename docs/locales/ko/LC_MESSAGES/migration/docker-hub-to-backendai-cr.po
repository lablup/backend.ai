"As of November 2020, the Docker Hub has begun to limit the retention time "
"and the rate of pulls of public images. Since Backend.AI uses a number of "
"Docker images with variety of access frequencies, we decided to migrate to "
"our own container registry, https://cr.backend.ai."

"It is strongly recommended to set a maintenance period if there are active "
"users of the Backend.AI cluster to prevent new session starts during "
"migration. This registry migration does not affect existing running "
"sessions, though the Docker image removal in the agent nodes can only be "
"done after terminating all existing containers started with the old images "
"and there will be brief disconnection of service ports as the manager "
"requires to be restarted."

"The agents will automatically pull the images since the image references are "
"changed even when the new images are actually same to the existing ones. It "
