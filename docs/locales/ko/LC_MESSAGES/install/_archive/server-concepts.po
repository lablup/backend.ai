"Each border-connected group of components is intended to be run on the same "
"server, but you may split them into multiple servers or merge different "
"groups into a single server as you need. For example, you can run separate "
"servers for the nginx reverse-proxy and the Backend.AI manager or run both "
"on a single server. In the [[development setup]], all these components run "
"on a single PC such as your laptop."

"In Backend.AI, we generally call the containers spawned upon user requests "
"as kernels. In detail, what the user requests is a compute session (with "
"user-provided options), and kernels are the members of that session. This "
"means that a single compute session may have multiple kernels across "
"different agent servers for parallel and distribute processing."

"Note that all kernel images must be downloaded during Backend.AI "
"installation. Each agent may have different sets of kernel images: for "
"instance, you could set up a cluster where GPU servers have GPU-enabled "

"kernels."

"Backend.AI manager is the central governor of the cluster. It accepts user "

"and also mediates the input/output of kernels. Each agent also reports the "

"new kernels on idle servers to load balance."
