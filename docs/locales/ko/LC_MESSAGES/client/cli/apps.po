"The following command first spawns a Python session named \"mysession\" "
"without running any code immediately, and then executes a local proxy which "
"connects to the \"jupyter\" service running inside the session via the local "
"TCP port 9900. The ``start`` command shows application services provided by "
"the created compute session so that you can choose one in the subsequent "
"``app`` command. In the ``start`` command, you can specify detailed resource "
"options using ``-r`` and storage mounts using ``-m`` parameter."

"Once executed, the ``app`` command waits for the user to open the displayed "
"address using appropriate application. For the jupyter service, use your "
"favorite web browser just like the way you use Jupyter Notebooks. To stop "
"the ``app`` command, press ``Ctrl+C`` or send the ``SIGINT`` signal."
