"vfolder (virtual folder) is created under a designated storage mount (called "
"\"vfolder hosts\"). Virtual folders are mounted into compute session "

"``/mnt/vfroot/mynfs``). Common setups may use a centralized network storage "
"(served via NFS or SMB), but for more scalability, one might want to use "
