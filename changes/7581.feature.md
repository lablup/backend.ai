Add RBAC-aware entity management utilities including Creator, Purger, and Granter classes. Creator handles entity creation with automatic scope association, Purger performs entity deletion with cascading removal of related RBAC data (permissions, roles, associations), and Granter grants object-level permissions on entities to specific scopes. These proxy patterns provide reusable abstractions for consistent RBAC operations across different entity types.
