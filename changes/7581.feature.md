Add RBAC-aware entity management utilities including Creator, Purger, and Inviter classes. Creator handles entity creation with automatic scope association, Purger performs entity deletion with cascading removal of related RBAC data (permissions, roles, associations), and Inviter grants permissions on entities to users within specific scopes. These proxy patterns provide reusable abstractions for consistent RBAC operations across different entity types.
