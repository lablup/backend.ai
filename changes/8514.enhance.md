Add `service.instance.id` and `service.instance.name` OpenTelemetry resource attributes to enable per-instance log filtering in Loki/Grafana. The `service.instance.id` uses the service's unique UUID (generated fresh on each restart) to distinguish individual process executions, following OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for tracing process lifecycles.
