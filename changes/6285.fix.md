Fix an issue where the Storage Proxy would unnecessarily attempt to create an XFS backend lockfile at `/tmp/backendai-xfs-file-lock` even when XFS storage was not configured. This could cause permission errors if the Storage Proxy lacked access to the `/tmp` directory, preventing the service from starting properly.
