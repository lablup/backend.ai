Fixed a KeyError that occurred when domain administrators attempted to validate quota scope access due to incorrect user dictionary key reference. The validation function now correctly accesses the `domain_name` key instead of the non-existent `domain` key, preventing errors for both user dictionaries and UserRow ORM objects.
