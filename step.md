# Resource Preset Service Test Implementation Steps

## Steps to Complete:

### Step 1: Analyze test scenario for resource_preset
- [x] Read test_scenario/resource_preset.md
- [x] Identify key test requirements

### Step 2: Review current implementation
- [x] Check src/ai/backend/manager/services/resource_preset/service.py
- [x] Compare with legacy implementation if available
- [x] Determine compatibility

### Step 3: Create test code or document changes
- [x] If compatible: Write tests in tests/manager/services/resource_preset/test_resource_preset.py
- [ ] If not compatible: Document in NEED_TO_CHANGE.md

### Step 4: Create service documentation
- [x] Write src/ai/backend/manager/services/resource_preset/README.md

### Step 5: Validate code quality
- [x] Run pants lint ::
- [x] Run pants fmt ::
- [x] Run pants check ::
- [x] Run pants test ::

## Progress:
- Starting work on resource_preset service
- Analyzed test scenario and found 5 main functions to test
- Compared current implementation with legacy - they are compatible
- Created comprehensive test file with all test scenarios covered
- Fixed import paths and moved test files to correct location
- All linting and formatting checks passed
- Tests created and partially passing (12/25 passed)
