# Write specs — Knowledge

> Rules: `AGENTS.md` in the same directory.

## Why this package exists

Write specs turn "what to write" (rows, memberships, integrity checks) into
declarations next to the schema, while execution is owned by the ops layer. It
exists so that the RBAC side effects of a write — provisioning in the graph,
registering memberships — are decided by the **spec's type**, not by the
execution path.

## Spec selection: the only remaining question is "is it an entity"

**Every entity has a node in the graph** — it can own memberships and can be shared.

| Spec | Criterion | Write behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Entity | First-class entity (vfolder/session/...) | create provisions the node (self membership + self binding) and joins each `member_of()` target; purge tears down symmetrically; upsert stays idempotent |
| Entity, role-managed | Entities that grant preset roles (domain/project/user) | Entity behavior + preset role creation — must be declared via the combined `RoleManagedEntity*` root |
| Global | An entity that goes under no other entity | Entity behavior minus `member_of` — the node is provisioned the same way |
| Field | A row another entity owns (even with its own get/delete API) | create requires `owner_id`; purge is a plain delete |

## The absence of a common ABC is itself the enforcement mechanism

- With a shared supertype, an entity spec passed to an execution path that provisions
  nothing would pass type checking and silently skip it — exactly the bug this lineage
  is meant to prevent.
- Duplicating method declarations across roots is the price of making that path
  inexpressible.
- Execution-logic reuse happens via ops helpers that take plain values.

## The role-managed root not being a subtype is the same mechanism

- If `RoleManagedEntityCreator` were a subtype of `EntityCreator`, it would pass type
  checking on the plain `create_entity` path and silently skip preset roles.
- The entity hooks are duplicated onto the combined root so that the only path that
  accepts it is the role-managed path.
- `RoleTemplateSource` remains the sole shared base because no write path accepts it
  on its own.

## Why a global entity is provisioned too

Rows are created under a global entity as well — an image under its container
registry. Without a node those rows have nothing to point their membership at, and
the global entity itself is reachable by nobody but a super-admin.

The delete side always tore the node down (`purge_entity` calls `_teardown_entity`).
The create side removed the asymmetry of tearing down what was never built.

## A field row's membership is only knowable through its owner

- A field row carries no membership of its own, so an operation naming one has nothing
  to validate and nothing to record against. `FieldOwnerLookup` fills that in: from a
  field row's id to its owning entity's id.
- It declares a query rather than conditions for two reasons. An owner may be reachable
  only through a join, and selecting the pair (row id, owner id) is what keeps a batch
  from losing which row each owner belongs to.
- It is generic because `Select`'s type parameter is invariant: a concrete column type
  does not match a loosely declared one, so the implementation states both of its own.
  `DataBatchPurger` is generic over its row type for the same reason.

## Soft delete is guarded by the absence of a field

The same mechanism as the spec roots: what stops a write is the shape of the
declaration, not a check at execution time.

A soft delete is an UPDATE at the DB, so ops cannot tell it apart from an edit — there
is no delete operation to generalize and no place there to enforce anything. What
separates them is the action's `operation_type()`, which decides the RBAC permission
and the audit row's `operation`.

That leaves one hole: an ordinary edit that writes the lifecycle column would be
recorded as `UPDATE`, and the deletion would never appear in the trail. Removing the
field from the general updater closes it — the edit path has nothing to make the
transition with. Splitting delete and restore into their own updaters with constant
`build_values()` closes the rest: a transition value taken as an argument is a value
that can be passed wrong.

Which column carries the state is domain knowledge and varies (`deleted` on a role
preset, `status` on a vfolder or user), which is why this is a rule about the general
updater's fields rather than about a column name.

## member_of is membership, not sharing

- `member_of(row)` declares ontological belonging at creation time — a project joins
  its domain, a keypair joins its user.
- It carries no permission caps — cap-bounded access is the object-sharing mechanism
  applied to existing entities and has its own audit trail.
- Keeping the two separate keeps creation declarative and sharing revocable.

## Entity type is an open string

- This is so a new type can register members before the permission layer knows about
  it — only permission-carrying paths convert lazily and reject there.
- The registration-time integrity guarantee is: "a write against a target with no node
  fails".
- The axis that separated scope type from entity type is gone from the spec hooks.
  Every entity has a node, so there was nothing left to separate.
