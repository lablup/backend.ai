# testcases

This package defines concrete test scenarios and specifications for the testing framework. Testcases combine templates and contexts to implement real-world test flows, such as user login, session creation, or resource management.

Testcases are the main entry point for defining what to test, how to test it, and how to organize and select tests for execution.
