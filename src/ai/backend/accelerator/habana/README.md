Backend.AI Accelerator Plugin for Habana
======================================

Just install this along with Backend.AI agents, using the same virtual environment.
This will allow the agents to detect Habana devices on their hosts and make them
available to Backend.AI kernel sessions.

```console
$ pip install -e <Path to this repository>
```

This open-source edition of Habana plugins support allocation of one or more Habana
devices to a container, slot-by-slot.
