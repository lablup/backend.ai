Backend.AI Accelerator Plugin for TPU
=====================================

Just install this along with Backend.AI agents, using the same virtual environment.
This will allow the agents to detect TPU devices on their hosts and make them
available to Backend.AI kernel sessions.

```console
$ pip install backend.ai-accelerator-tpu
```

**NOTICE:** The accelerator plugin API is currently under development and may change
with the Backend.AI agents without prior notices. This means this plugin may stop
working suddenly and it is your responsibility to keep it up to date.
