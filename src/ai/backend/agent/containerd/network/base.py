"""Pluggable network-provider abstraction for the containerd backend.

A ``NetworkProvider`` attaches a containerd workload's network namespace
to a cluster network. The generic CNI mechanics — netns lifecycle and the
plugin-chain exec — are shared (see ``netns`` and ``cni``); each provider
(Cilium, Calico, bridge, …) adds only what genuinely differs between CNI
implementations: identity/labels, network-policy lifecycle, provider
preflight, and out-of-band APIs. The CNI *exec protocol* itself is
uniform, so it is deliberately not part of this abstraction.
